This project is a GUI-based biomarker information system developed using Python Tkinter.  
The application allows users to enter a biomarker name and retrieves the associated disease along with its symptoms, causes, risk factors, and treatments.

The system also provides:
- Biological pathways involved in the disease
- Drug information with mechanism of action
- Research publications with clickable PubMed links

All information is stored using structured Python dictionaries, making the application lightweight and easy to use without external database installation.
