## Workflow Pipeline

1. **Tkinter GUI Window**
   - The application starts with a graphical user interface created using Python Tkinter.
   - Provides a simple and interactive environment for user input.

2. **Biomarker Input**
   - User enters a biomarker name (e.g., Troponin, CA-125, HbA1c).
   - Input is taken through a text entry field.

3. **Biomarker Matching**
   - The entered biomarker is matched against a predefined Python dictionary.
   - If the biomarker exists, corresponding disease information is retrieved.
   - If not found, an error message is displayed.

4. **Disease Information Display**
   - The system displays:
     - Disease name
     - Symptoms
     - Cause
     - Risk factors
     - Treatment
   - Information is shown in a structured GUI window.

5. **Pathway Information**
   - Users can open a separate window to view disease-related biological pathways.
   - Each pathway includes a short description.
   - A simulated pathway network view is provided.

6. **Drug Information**
   - Displays commonly used drugs related to the identified disease.
   - Includes brief descriptions of their mechanism of action.

7. **Research Publications**
   - Lists relevant scientific publications.
   - Provides publication title, PubMed ID, and clickable links.
   - Clicking the link opens the research paper in a web browser.

8. **Output**
   - A complete biomarker-to-disease identification pipeline with clinical, biological, and therapeutic insights.
